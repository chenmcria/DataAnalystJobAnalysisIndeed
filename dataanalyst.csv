The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) is a global marine research and technology platform, headquartered at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, tasked with bringing together and empowering an international community of telemetry users (http://oceantrackingnetwork.org). OTN and its partners track and monitor keystone, commercially important, and endangered species and how they move within the global ocean in the face of changing ocean conditions.

o Provide input to the design of OTN end-product development from loaded data.
o Assist with training workshops for parties working with the OTN data system.

o Provide input to the design of OTN data quality procedures.
o Assure accuracy, integrity and security of data.

Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and Grab.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this new mode of transit. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

The company has proven its first successful product-line for tubular infrastructure inspection. DarkVision's initial product has already won multiple industry awards, been featured in top publications, and generated significant revenue. Our team consists of experts from machine vision, medical imaging, aerospace, and computer graphics sectors who are building today's most advanced technology platform for industrial imaging and asset integrity-related inspection. We build, design, and sell the entire solution ourselves – from large sensor arrays to specialized electronics, to our visualization and analytics software.
Building on its commercial success, the company just raised a very large financing round to begin scaling the technology to new product-lines in new industries and applications. We recently began construction of a new 52,000 sq ft head office facility in Vancouver and are growing quickly.

'A' Players: Our team is made up of talented, intelligent, and hardworking people. If you're an 'A' player, you'll enjoy the intellectually stimulating, challenging and respectfully competitive atmosphere.
Growing Quickly: We're in the process of opening US Offices, launching several new product-lines and hiring a high-performing team of people. We are not a small start-up company and are in the process of maturing into a fast-growing medium-sized business.

Who we are
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and vans. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, San Diego County, Grab, and Calgary Transit.
Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.
RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

Job Summary

The UBC Department of Family Practice (DFP) has established the primary care Innovation Support Unit (ISU) to connect, engage, and partner with those who are actively involved in innovations in primary care. The ISU is initially focused on supporting innovations in community-situated, team-based care (TBC) in BC, which includes initiatives in primary care transformation such as the Patient's Medical Home (PMH) and Primary Care Networks (PCNs) as these are key provincial strategic elements in achieving a sustainable and high-quality community and primary care system in BC. We are working with collaborators at UBC, the Ministry of Health, BC primary care communities, and several other groups.

The ISU has a number of independent, strategic workstreams related to specific aspects of TBC transformation in Primary Care. Workstreams are a collection of applied, mixed-method action-oriented research projects clustering around a particular pressing issue or need in primary care in BC. Workstreams may focus different areas such as design, testing and deployment of new methods to support change, development of team-based care evaluation framework, or development of EMR based evaluation methods for team-based care.

The Research Analysts will work with Workstream leads and ISU faculty, to perform a range of data collection, analysis, facilitation, and report drafting activities as required.

The ISU has been established as a small but nimble and highly networked team, working with many stakeholders. We are currently expanding, looking to hire 3 more analysts to the team to support the workstreams. Some of the planned work will require more familiarity with quantitative analysis. As a member of a Teal organizational structure, ISU Research Analysts are responsible for engaging across workstream as required and as fits the skills of each of the team members. In this way, the ISU seeks to match team members to projects / workstreams that build on their strengths and skills. The ISU has opportunities for people with a range of skills and experience to broaden the team's views as we tackle the complex challenges in primary care and so we are looking for a broad range of experiences to complement other members of the team.

We are seeking analysts with a desire to engage with skills or experience in primary care or applicable quantitative, qualitative, and action research methods as well as knowledge translation, multimedia, and/or design methods.



Organizational Status

The Department of Family Practice supports researchers and faculty throughout the province. The ISU is a core unit of the department whose goal is to bring an applied academic lens to the changes that are actively occurring in primary care across the province. The ISU's initial focus has been on team-based care. The ISU collaborates with the Ministry of Health, Health Authorities, Divisions of Family Practice, communities, and other provincial organizations to develop and link evidence to change initiatives. The ISU seeks to inform new models of care, test assumptions and gather data to inform system changes.



Work Performed

Specifically, the work will include:

1). Support ISU workstreams by completing specific work, such as:
a. Work with ISU team members on planning of workstreams.
b. Engage in rapid review of evidence, partner documents and compile draft reports
c. Develop Workstream proposals
d. Review and synthesis of quantitative data to inform the development of tools
e. Leading analysis of findings
f. Work with leads to develop draft models for describing service needs and service capacity in primary care
g. Draft findings and reports
h. Develop health data analysis (e.g. EMR queries) to support quality improvement and / or evaluation of team based care
i. Prepare ethics review submissions

2). Spread ISU developed tools and methods
a. Prepare Facilitator Training Sessions and other KT events
b. Engage in facilitator training through in person and virtual platforms as co-facilitator
c. Collate feedback and assist in the revision of the tools and methods

3). Develop resources and tools to support Knowledge Mobilization
a. Prepare drafts of academic articles
b. Develop drafts of other knowledge dissemination products, including outlines / scripts for videos, podcasts, or webinars (this could include participating in the production of such multimedia knowledge products)

4). Work with ISU team
a. Engage in ISU team activities (meetings, design fests, etc.)
b. Contribute to the internal work of the ISU as a team (take on internal team roles, provide feedback on new ideas, etc.)
c. Prepare, edit, and proof grant applications, contracts, and scientific communications

The successful candidates will play a role within the ISU that matches their strengths and the needs of our partner projects. Thus, the candidate may focus more or less on one of the above aspects.



Supervision Received

The ISU manager will provide direct supervision. The analyst will work with considerable latitude with research work reviewed against achievement of project objectives. The successful candidate will report to the ISU leadership within the Department of Family Practice.



Supervision Given

May be asked to provide supervision to students in collaboration with ISU Coordinators and ISU Manager.



Consequence of Error/Judgement

The Research Analyst will be dealing with data that is sensitive in nature and confidential and as such will be required to exercise discretion. The Research Analyst will make professional decisions and recommendations on all aspects of the research work and be responsible for the quality of research activities. The Research Analyst will be a representative of the Dept. of Family Practice and ISU and thus will be required to demonstrate a high degree of expertise and professionalism.



Qualifications

Undergraduate degree in a relevant discipline. A BSc in a related field (e.g. Health Information Science, Life Sciences, Public Health) or, ideally, an MSc would be preferred. Minimum of three years experience or the equivalent combination of education and experience. Experience in evaluation methods - qualitative or quantitative - and group facilitation (of focus groups and/or other community engagement strategies) is also desired. Experience in working with quantitative data, and a background in health informatics, specifically EMRs, is an asset, as is experience in media production for knowledge mobilization, or design thinking in health care.

Work in primary care or overlapping areas, or clinical experience in primary care, an asset. Experience with data analysis (e.g. health data analysis) an asset. The successful candidate will be an enthusiastic and resourceful team member, with excellent interpersonal and communication skills (written and oral) in order to interact effectively with colleagues, clinicians, and stakeholders. The ISU will be working virtually for at least the next 4 months and is a distributed team. There is a possibility that, in the future, travel will be required when working with partner projects (expected to be overnight trips, up to 2-4 times / month).





.
Equity and diversity are essential to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds enumerated under the B.C. Human Rights Code, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person.

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.

Job Summary

The Statistical Analyst will provide analytic and reporting expertise to the Principal Investigator and other members of the research team. This involves accessing data provided by partner organizations, creating datasets for the purposes of analyses, planning analysis, conducting the analyses, and reporting the results.



Organizational Status

The vision of the UBC Department of Emergency Medicine is to be a provincially integrated Department committed to clinical and academic leadership in the creation and exchange of knowledge to promote excellence in emergency care. Our faculty members across the province have had an impressive record of research and discovery. Our research and innovation initiatives include 14 successful programs related to prevention of emergencies, improving clinical care, and system improvements. Road Safety Research is one of the key strategic initiatives of the UBC Department of Emergency Medicine.

The road safety research team is also affiliated with the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) Emergency Medicine (EM) Research Program which is part of the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. The VGH Emergency Department (ED) treats 90,000 of the most complex and critically ill patients in the province annually. VGH Emergency Department includes over 50 physicians with Royal College specialist certification in emergency medicine, 200 nurses and numerous ancillary staff. The VGH EM Research Program conducts numerous internal and external projects that are recruiting participants from the VGH ED. We have a research office located centrally in the ED, a Research Director and a research advisory committee.

The road safety research team focuses on drug impaired driving, traffic policy evaluation, outcome after road trauma, and active transportation. Most of the analyst's work will pertain to road safety research, specifically data analysis for a large inception cohort study of outcome after road trauma. This project investigates health related quality of life following road trauma, recovery trajectory, and risk factors for a poor recovery. A similar project focusing on active transport (cyclist and pedestrian injuries) of recovery is planned. Although the focus will be on road safety, the analyst may, with the Research Director's approval, provide statistical consultation for other VGH EM Research Program investigators and/or EM residents.

The Statistical Analyst reports to the Principal Investigator, Dr Jeff Brubacher. The incumbent will work collaboratively with other team members to manage and analyze data. The analyst will interact with other research team members and with external collaborators including policy makers, data custodians, and other road safety stakeholders as well as medical students, residents and healthcare professionals both within and outside the Department of Emergency Medicine.



Work Performed

Collaborates with other researchers and statisticians in the identification and completion of assigned research projects. The incumbent will write statistical reports, present the results in scheduled meetings and participate in writing scientific journal papers.
Manages complex large datasets using a variety of software and languages to explore data validity, develop research variables and conduct statistical analysis.
Works with multiple study designs.
Plans, performs and interprets statistical data analysis.
Identifies problems with data and suggests options to the PIs and data manager.
Ensures that all required confidentiality, privacy and data security processes are followed.
Works with PI and research team to develop and write the analysis plan and methods sections for grant applications and for research manuscripts and scientific journals.
Prepares written reports to summarize results for quick dissemination to stakeholders and funders.
Mentors students and residents, delegates work to the team members.
Presents posters at conferences, writes academic manuscripts and technical reports.
Performs other duties as required.



Supervision Received

The incumbent works independently on a day-to-day basis. The incumbent receives overall direction from the Principal Investigator. The incumbent meets with the Principal Investigator and research team on a weekly basis and more often as required.



Supervision Given

The incumbent will provide guidance on analytic issues to other investigators, residents and students as requested by the Principal Investigator.



Consequence of Error/Judgement

Our projects are under tight timelines. The impact of incorrect decisions and errors in judgment would delay productivity and/or loss of data integrity. In the most extreme scenario, the delay in reporting of results to funders would result in loss of operating funds. Inappropriate handling of confidential and sensitive data would result in the loss of privilege in conducting research with the administrative data and could harm future collaboration with data custodians. The incumbent is expected to alert the PIs to any unusual situations, which may affect the project, and to keep the PIs advised of problems that have arisen or that can be anticipated.



Qualifications

Post-graduate degree in Statistics. Minimum of two years experience in research analysis or the equivalent combination of education and experience. Previous experience working with large databases is required. Previous experience with statistical modeling including generalized linear mixed models, ARIMA, techniques for accommodating spatial and temporal correlation, and GIS mapping are required. Familiarity with British Columbia police crash data (the Traffic Accident System), ICBC claims data, and British Columbia Ambulance Service data is required. Sound knowledge in computation and statistics are essential, including efficient coding to process large volumes of data. Demonstrated knowledge of appropriate statistical methods for various study designs, such as interrupted time series, case-crossover, and matched cohort studies. Effective oral and written communication, interpersonal and problem-solving skills. Ability to exercise appropriate tact, discretion and confidentiality in all matters. Ability to work effectively under pressure to meet deadlines. Ability to work effectively both independently and collaboratively in a team environment. Ability to work a flexible schedule and additional hours occasionally on weekends may be required.

Job Summary

The Statistical Analyst will provide analytic and reporting expertise to the Principal Investigator and other members of the research team. This involves accessing data provided by partner organizations, creating datasets for the purposes of analyses, planning analysis, conducting the analyses, and reporting the results.



Organizational Status

The vision of the UBC Department of Emergency Medicine is to be a provincially integrated Department committed to clinical and academic leadership in the creation and exchange of knowledge to promote excellence in emergency care. Our faculty members across the province have had an impressive record of research and discovery. Our research and innovation initiatives include 14 successful programs related to prevention of emergencies, improving clinical care, and system improvements. Road Safety Research is one of the key strategic initiatives of the UBC Department of Emergency Medicine.

The road safety research team is also affiliated with the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) Emergency Medicine (EM) Research Program which is part of the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute. The VGH Emergency Department (ED) treats 90,000 of the most complex and critically ill patients in the province annually. VGH Emergency Department includes over 50 physicians with Royal College specialist certification in emergency medicine, 200 nurses and numerous ancillary staff. The VGH EM Research Program conducts numerous internal and external projects that are recruiting participants from the VGH ED. We have a research office located centrally in the ED, a Research Director and a research advisory committee.

The road safety research team focuses on drug impaired driving, traffic policy evaluation, outcome after road trauma, and active transportation. Most of the analyst's work will pertain to road safety research, specifically data analysis for a large inception cohort study of outcome after road trauma. This project investigates health related quality of life following road trauma, recovery trajectory, and risk factors for a poor recovery. A similar project focusing on active transport (cyclist and pedestrian injuries) of recovery is planned. Although the focus will be on road safety, the analyst may, with the Research Director's approval, provide statistical consultation for other VGH EM Research Program investigators and/or EM residents.

The Statistical Analyst reports to the Principal Investigator, Dr Jeff Brubacher. The incumbent will work collaboratively with other team members to manage and analyze data. The analyst will interact with other research team members and with external collaborators including policy makers, data custodians, and other road safety stakeholders as well as medical students, residents and healthcare professionals both within and outside the Department of Emergency Medicine.



Work Performed

Collaborates with other researchers and statisticians in the identification and completion of assigned research projects. The incumbent will write statistical reports, present the results in scheduled meetings and participate in writing scientific journal papers.
Manages complex large datasets using a variety of software and languages to explore data validity, develop research variables and conduct statistical analysis.
Works with multiple study designs.
Plans, performs and interprets statistical data analysis.
Identifies problems with data and suggests options to the PIs and data manager.
Ensures that all required confidentiality, privacy and data security processes are followed.
Works with PI and research team to develop and write the analysis plan and methods sections for grant applications and for research manuscripts and scientific journals.
Prepares written reports to summarize results for quick dissemination to stakeholders and funders.
Mentors students and residents, delegates work to the team members.
Presents posters at conferences, writes academic manuscripts and technical reports.
Performs other duties as required.



Supervision Received

The incumbent works independently on a day-to-day basis. The incumbent receives overall direction from the Principal Investigator. The incumbent meets with the Principal Investigator and research team on a weekly basis and more often as required.



Supervision Given

The incumbent will provide guidance on analytic issues to other investigators, residents and students as requested by the Principal Investigator.



Consequence of Error/Judgement

Our projects are under tight timelines. The impact of incorrect decisions and errors in judgment would delay productivity and/or loss of data integrity. In the most extreme scenario, the delay in reporting of results to funders would result in loss of operating funds. Inappropriate handling of confidential and sensitive data would result in the loss of privilege in conducting research with the administrative data and could harm future collaboration with data custodians. The incumbent is expected to alert the PIs to any unusual situations, which may affect the project, and to keep the PIs advised of problems that have arisen or that can be anticipated.



Qualifications

Post-graduate degree in Statistics. Minimum of two years experience in research analysis or the equivalent combination of education and experience. Previous experience working with large databases is required. Previous experience with statistical modeling including generalized linear mixed models, ARIMA, techniques for accommodating spatial and temporal correlation, and GIS mapping are required. Familiarity with British Columbia police crash data (the Traffic Accident System), ICBC claims data, and British Columbia Ambulance Service data is required. Sound knowledge in computation and statistics are essential, including efficient coding to process large volumes of data. Demonstrated knowledge of appropriate statistical methods for various study designs, such as interrupted time series, case-crossover, and matched cohort studies. Effective oral and written communication, interpersonal and problem-solving skills. Ability to exercise appropriate tact, discretion and confidentiality in all matters. Ability to work effectively under pressure to meet deadlines. Ability to work effectively both independently and collaboratively in a team environment. Ability to work a flexible schedule and additional hours occasionally on weekends may be required.





.
Equity and diversity are essential to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds enumerated under the B.C. Human Rights Code, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person.

All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply; however Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.

Consequence of Error/Judgement

Our projects are under tight timelines. The impact of incorrect decisions and errors in judgment would delay productivity and/or loss of data integrity.
